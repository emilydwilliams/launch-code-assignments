    "# **Week 4 Python Practice - Bonus Challenge**#\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a bonus challenge if you have time. There are 12 data scientists that work for Big Data Corp. Four of them have just joined the team as LaunchCode apprentices. To build camaraderie, the team decides to have a mini data hackathon. They'll divide themselves into 3 teams of 4 people. Because they are data scientists, they want a python program that will randomly assign people to the three teams. In the interest of fairness, they want to make sure no team has more than 2 apprentices assigned to it.\n",
